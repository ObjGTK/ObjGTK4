/**
 * A `PangoLayout` structure represents an entire paragraph of text.
 * 
 * While complete access to the layout capabilities of Pango is provided
 * using the detailed interfaces for itemization and shaping, using
 * that functionality directly involves writing a fairly large amount
 * of code. `PangoLayout` provides a high-level driver for formatting
 * entire paragraphs of text at once. This includes paragraph-level
 * functionality such as line breaking, justification, alignment and
 * ellipsization.
 * 
 * A `PangoLayout` is initialized with a `PangoContext`, UTF-8 string
 * and set of attributes for that string. Once that is done, the set of
 * formatted lines can be extracted from the object, the layout can be
 * rendered, and conversion between logical character positions within
 * the layout's text, and the physical position of the resulting glyphs
 * can be made.
 * 
 * There are a number of parameters to adjust the formatting of a
 * `PangoLayout`. The following image shows adjustable parameters
 * (on the left) and font metrics (on the right):
 * 
 * <picture>
 *   <source srcset="layout-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
 *   <img alt="Pango Layout Parameters" src="layout-light.png">
 * </picture>
 * 
 * The following images demonstrate the effect of alignment and
 * justification on the layout of text:
 * 
 * | | |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | ![align=left](align-left.png) | ![align=left, justify](align-left-justify.png) |
 * | ![align=center](align-center.png) | ![align=center, justify](align-center-justify.png) |
 * | ![align=right](align-right.png) | ![align=right, justify](align-right-justify.png) |
 * 
 * 
 * It is possible, as well, to ignore the 2-D setup,
 * and simply treat the results of a `PangoLayout` as a list of lines.
