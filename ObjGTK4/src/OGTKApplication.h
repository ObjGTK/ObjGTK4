/**
 * `GtkApplication` is a high-level API for writing applications.
 * 
 * It supports many aspects of writing a GTK application in a convenient
 * fashion, without enforcing a one-size-fits-all model.
 * 
 * Currently, `GtkApplication` handles GTK initialization, application
 * uniqueness, session management, provides some basic scriptability and
 * desktop shell integration by exporting actions and menus and manages a
 * list of toplevel windows whose life-cycle is automatically tied to the
 * life-cycle of your application.
 * 
 * While `GtkApplication` works fine with plain [class@Gtk.Window]s, it is
 * recommended to use it together with [class@Gtk.ApplicationWindow].
 * 
 * ## Automatic resources
 * 
 * `GtkApplication` will automatically load menus from the `GtkBuilder`
 * resource located at "gtk/menus.ui", relative to the application's
 * resource base path (see [method@Gio.Application.set_resource_base_path]).
 * The menu with the ID "menubar" is taken as the application's
 * menubar. Additional menus (most interesting submenus) can be named
 * and accessed via [method@Gtk.Application.get_menu_by_id] which allows for
 * dynamic population of a part of the menu structure.
 * 
 * Note that automatic resource loading uses the resource base path
 * that is set at construction time and will not work if the resource
 * base path is changed at a later time.
 * 
 * It is also possible to provide the menubar manually using
 * [method@Gtk.Application.set_menubar].
 * 
 * `GtkApplication` will also automatically setup an icon search path for
 * the default icon theme by appending "icons" to the resource base
 * path. This allows your application to easily store its icons as
 * resources. See [method@Gtk.IconTheme.add_resource_path] for more
 * information.
 * 
 * If there is a resource located at `gtk/help-overlay.ui` which
 * defines a [class@Gtk.ShortcutsWindow] with ID `help_overlay` then
 * `GtkApplication` associates an instance of this shortcuts window with
 * each [class@Gtk.ApplicationWindow] and sets up the keyboard accelerator
 * <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> to open it. To create a menu item that
 * displays the shortcuts window, associate the item with the action
 * `win.show-help-overlay`.
 * 
 * ## A simple application
 * 
 * [A simple example](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/main/examples/bp/bloatpad.c)
 * is available in the GTK source code repository
 * 
 * `GtkApplication` optionally registers with a session manager of the
 * users session (if you set the [property@Gtk.Application:register-session]
 * property) and offers various functionality related to the session
 * life-cycle.
 * 
 * An application can block various ways to end the session with
 * the [method@Gtk.Application.inhibit] function. Typical use cases for
 * this kind of inhibiting are long-running, uninterruptible operations,
 * such as burning a CD or performing a disk backup. The session
 * manager may not honor the inhibitor, but it can be expected to
 * inform the user about the negative consequences of ending the
 * session while inhibitors are present.
 * 
 * ## See Also
