/**
 * The selection object for GtkTreeView
 * 
 * The `GtkTreeSelection` object is a helper object to manage the selection
 * for a `GtkTreeView` widget.  The `GtkTreeSelection` object is
 * automatically created when a new `GtkTreeView` widget is created, and
 * cannot exist independently of this widget.  The primary reason the
 * `GtkTreeSelection` objects exists is for cleanliness of code and API.
 * That is, there is no conceptual reason all these functions could not be
 * methods on the `GtkTreeView` widget instead of a separate function.
 * 
 * The `GtkTreeSelection` object is gotten from a `GtkTreeView` by calling
 * gtk_tree_view_get_selection().  It can be manipulated to check the
 * selection status of the tree, as well as select and deselect individual
 * rows.  Selection is done completely view side.  As a result, multiple
 * views of the same model can have completely different selections.
 * Additionally, you cannot change the selection of a row on the model that
 * is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its parents
 * first.
 * 
 * One of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of
 * a view is that the `GtkTreeSelection`::changed signal is mostly a hint.
 * That is, it may only emit one signal when a range of rows is selected.
 * Additionally, it may on occasion emit a `GtkTreeSelection`::changed signal
 * when nothing has happened (mostly as a result of programmers calling
 * select_row on an already selected row).
