 * This affects sorting, filtering and headers.
 * 
 * Note that calls to this method must be in sync with the data
 * used for the row functions. For instance, if the list is
 * mirroring some external data set, and *two* rows changed in the
 * external data set then when you call gtk_list_box_row_changed()
 * on the first row the sort function must only read the new data
 * for the first of the two changed rows, otherwise the resorting
 * of the rows will be wrong.
 * 
 * This generally means that if you donâ€™t fully control the data
 * model you have to duplicate the data that affects the listbox
 * row functions into the row widgets themselves. Another alternative
 * is to call [method@Gtk.ListBox.invalidate_sort] on any model change,
 * but that is more expensive.
