/**
 * `GtkGesture` is the base class for gesture recognition.
 * 
 * Although `GtkGesture` is quite generalized to serve as a base for
 * multi-touch gestures, it is suitable to implement single-touch and
 * pointer-based gestures (using the special %NULL `GdkEventSequence`
 * value for these).
 * 
 * The number of touches that a `GtkGesture` need to be recognized is
 * controlled by the [property@Gtk.Gesture:n-points] property, if a
 * gesture is keeping track of less or more than that number of sequences,
 * it won't check whether the gesture is recognized.
 * 
 * As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, it will check
 * regularly if it is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as
 * "recognized" is left to `GtkGesture` subclasses.
 * 
 * A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
 * 
 * - [signal@Gtk.Gesture::begin] when the gesture is recognized.
 * - [signal@Gtk.Gesture::update], whenever an input event is processed.
 * - [signal@Gtk.Gesture::end] when the gesture is no longer recognized.
 * 
 * ## Event propagation
 * 
 * In order to receive events, a gesture needs to set a propagation phase
 * through [method@Gtk.EventController.set_propagation_phase].
 * 
 * In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down
 * to the target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers
 * above the widget get a chance to interact with the event before it
 * reaches the target.
 * 
 * In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget
 * to the toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above
 * the widget get a chance to interact with events that have not been
 * handled yet.
 * 
 * ## States of a sequence
 * 
 * Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade
 * of `GtkGesture`s, both across the parents of the widget receiving the
 * event and in parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility
 * of the widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences
 * accordingly in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the
 * `GdkEventSequence`s triggering those.
 * 
 * Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through [method@Gtk.Gesture.group].
 * Grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
 * [method@Gtk.Gesture.set_state] on one will effectively propagate
 * the state throughout the group.
 * 
 * By default, all sequences start out in the %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_NONE state,
 * sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
 * propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.
 * 
 * If a sequence enters into the %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED state, the gesture
 * group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
 * through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
 * the touch is active.
 * 
 * If a sequence enters in the %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED state, the gesture
 * group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
 * 
 * - Setting the same sequence to %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED on every other
 *   gesture group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets
 *   in the propagation chain.
 * - Emitting [signal@Gtk.Gesture::cancel] on every gesture in widgets
 *   underneath in the propagation chain.
 * - Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.
 * 
 * Note: if a sequence is set early to %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED on
 * %GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN/%GDK_BUTTON_PRESS (so those events are captured before
 * reaching the event widget, this implies %GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE), one similar
 * event will be emulated if the sequence changes to %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED.
 * This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
 * again.
 * 
 * Sequence states can't be changed freely.
 * See [method@Gtk.Gesture.set_state] to know about the possible
 * lifetimes of a `GdkEventSequence`.
 * 
 * ## Touchpad gestures
 * 
 * On the platforms that support it, `GtkGesture` will handle transparently
 * touchpad gesture events. The only precautions users of `GtkGesture` should
 * do to enable this support are:
 * 
 * - If the gesture has %GTK_PHASE_NONE, ensuring events of type
 *   %GDK_TOUCHPAD_SWIPE and %GDK_TOUCHPAD_PINCH are handled by the `GtkGesture`
 *
