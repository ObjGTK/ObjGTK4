/**
 * `GtkConstraint` describes a constraint between attributes of two widgets,
 *  expressed as a linear equation.
 * 
 * The typical equation for a constraint is:
 * 
 * ```
 *   target.target_attr = source.source_attr Ã— multiplier + constant
 * ```
 * 
 * Each `GtkConstraint` is part of a system that will be solved by a
 * [class@Gtk.ConstraintLayout] in order to allocate and position each
 * child widget or guide.
 * 
 * The source and target, as well as their attributes, of a `GtkConstraint`
 * instance are immutable after creation.
