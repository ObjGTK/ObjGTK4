/**
 * A `GtkTreeModel` which hides parts of an underlying tree model
 * 
 * A `GtkTreeModelFilter` is a tree model which wraps another tree model,
 * and can do the following things:
 * 
 * - Filter specific rows, based on data from a “visible column”, a column
 *   storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not,
 *   or based on the return value of a “visible function”, which gets a
 *   model, iter and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the
 *   row should be filtered or not.
 * 
 * - Modify the “appearance” of the model, using a modify function.
 *   This is extremely powerful and allows for just changing some
 *   values and also for creating a completely different model based
 *   on the given child model.
 * 
 * - Set a different root node, also known as a “virtual root”. You can pass
 *   in a `GtkTreePath` indicating the root node for the filter at construction
 *   time.
 * 
 * The basic API is similar to `GtkTreeModelSort`. For an example on its usage,
 * see the section on `GtkTreeModelSort`.
 * 
 * When using `GtkTreeModelFilter`, it is important to realize that
 * `GtkTreeModelFilter` maintains an internal cache of all nodes which are
 * visible in its clients. The cache is likely to be a subtree of the tree
 * exposed by the child model. `GtkTreeModelFilter` will not cache the entire
 * child model when unnecessary to not compromise the caching mechanism
 * that is exposed by the reference counting scheme. If the child model
 * implements reference counting, unnecessary signals may not be emitted
 * because of reference counting rule 3, see the `GtkTreeModel`
 * documentation. (Note that e.g. `GtkTreeStore` does not implement
 * reference counting and will always emit all signals, even when
 * the receiving node is not visible).
 * 
 * Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply.
 * In general, visible functions should only use data or properties from
 * the node for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings
 * or its parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child
 * node is not possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly.
 * When no such reference exists, no signals may be received for these child
 * nodes (see reference counting rule number 3 in the `GtkTreeModel` section).
 * 
 * Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state
 * of its child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore,
 * `GtkTreeModelFilter` explicitly supports this. For example, when a node
 * does not have any children, you might not want the node to be visible.
 * As soon as the first row is added to the node’s child level (or the
 * last row removed), the node’s visibility should be updated.
 * 
 * This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order
 * to accommodate this, `GtkTreeModelFilter` must make sure the necessary
 * signals are received from the child model. This is achieved by building,
 * for all nodes which are exposed as visible nodes to `GtkTreeModelFilter`'s
 * clients, the child level (if any) and take a reference on the first node
 * in this level. Furthermore, for every row-inserted, row-changed or
 * row-deleted signal (also these which were not handled because the node
 * was not cached), `GtkTreeModelFilter` will check if the visibility state
 * of any parent node has changed.
 * 
 * Beware, however, that this explicit support is limited to these two
 * cases. For example, if you want a node to be visible only if two nodes
 * in a child’s child level (2 levels deeper) are visible, you are on your
 * own. In this case, either rely on `GtkTreeStore` to emit all signals
 * because it does not implement reference counting, or for models that
 * do implement reference counting, obtain references on these child levels
 * yourself.
