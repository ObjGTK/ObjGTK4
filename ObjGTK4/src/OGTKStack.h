/**
 * `GtkStack` is a container which only shows one of its children
 * at a time.
 * 
 * In contrast to `GtkNotebook`, `GtkStack` does not provide a means
 * for users to change the visible child. Instead, a separate widget
 * such as [class@Gtk.StackSwitcher] or [class@Gtk.StackSidebar] can
 * be used with `GtkStack` to provide this functionality.
 * 
 * Transitions between pages can be animated as slides or fades. This
 * can be controlled with [method@Gtk.Stack.set_transition_type].
 * These animations respect the [property@Gtk.Settings:gtk-enable-animations]
 * setting.
 * 
 * `GtkStack` maintains a [class@Gtk.StackPage] object for each added
 * child, which holds additional per-child properties. You
 * obtain the `GtkStackPage` for a child with [method@Gtk.Stack.get_page]
 * and you can obtain a `GtkSelectionModel` containing all the pages
 * with [method@Gtk.Stack.get_pages].
 * 
 * # GtkStack as GtkBuildable
 * 
 * To set child-specific properties in a .ui file, create `GtkStackPage`
 * objects explicitly, and set the child widget as a property on it:
 * 
 * ```xml
 *   <object class="GtkStack" id="stack">
 *     <child>
 *       <object class="GtkStackPage">
 *         <property name="name">page1</property>
 *         <property name="title">In the beginningâ€¦</property>
 *         <property name="child">
 *           <object class="GtkLabel">
 *             <property name="label">It was dark</property>
 *           </object>
 *         </property>
 *       </object>
 *     </child>
 * ```
 * 
 * # CSS nodes
 * 
 * `GtkStack` has a single CSS node named stack.
 * 
 * # Accessibility
 * 
 * `GtkStack` uses the %GTK_ACCESSIBLE_ROLE_TAB_PANEL for the stack
 * pages, which are the accessible parent objects of the child widgets.
 *
