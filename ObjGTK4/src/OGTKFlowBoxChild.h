 * This affects sorting and filtering.
 * 
 * Note that calls to this method must be in sync with the data
 * used for the sorting and filtering functions. For instance, if
 * the list is mirroring some external data set, and *two* children
 * changed in the external data set when you call
 * gtk_flow_box_child_changed() on the first child, the sort function
 * must only read the new data for the first of the two changed
 * children, otherwise the resorting of the children will be wrong.
 * 
 * This generally means that if you donâ€™t fully control the data
 * model, you have to duplicate the data that affects the sorting
 * and filtering functions into the widgets themselves.
 * 
 * Another alternative is to call [method@Gtk.FlowBox.invalidate_sort]
 * on any model change, but that is more expensive.
